Create fake directives based on configuration,
The extension creates mock directives and roles based on :doc:`conf`,
for hiding unsupported directives and roles without modifying documents.

.. note:: For now, only directive is supported

It is especially useful when a certain directive/role is provided
by an incompatible extension, or the directive/roles is incompatible with your
current buidler or theme.
