.. note::

   We assume you already have a Sphinx documentation,
   if not, see `Getting Started with Sphinx`_.

First, downloading extension from PyPI (see :doc:`install` for more details):

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install sphinxnotes-mock

Then, add the extension name to ``extensions`` configuration item in your conf.py_:

.. code-block:: python

   extensions = [
             # …
             'sphinxnotes.mock',
             # …
             ]
